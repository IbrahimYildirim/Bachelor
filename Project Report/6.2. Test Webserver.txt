6.2 Test Webserver

The full functionality of the system relies on data transmission between the clients and the Web Service. The HTTP requests have to be tested. The tests should prove that the Web Service is implemented correctly. 
To test the HTTP requests a tool called POSTMAN is employed. POSTMAN is designed to create custom HTTP requests and view the HTTP responses. The testing has to be done during the Implementation phase and must be performed manually to verify that the WebService is sending back the responses as expected.

All of the POSTMAN HTTP request names can be seen below, plus a sample request.

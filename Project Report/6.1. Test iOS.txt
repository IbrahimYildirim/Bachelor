6.1 Testing iOS

Black-Box testing
The main part of the testing happened as black box testing. This means that the tester is aware that a particular input returns a certain, invariable output but is not aware of how the software produces the output in the first place. In order to test the application test cases with specifications & procedures were created. An example of a test case is stated below (the rest can be found in the Appendices section).

[Fig 1 - SportLook Test case 1]

The purpose of these test cases was mostly to provide a good user experience and make sure the app worked as expected for en end-user.

White-Box Testing
During development of the app, white-box testing was used by testing the different implemented methods. An example is listed below in the DataProvider. To White-Box test it, the method was called when loading the app, and then by looking in the console it was possible to see what happened in the method.

Debugging
The Xcode debugging tool was also widely used in order to test the app and make sure everything was working as it was expected during development. 
The code execution can be stopped with the usage of a break-point and variables can be inspected.
